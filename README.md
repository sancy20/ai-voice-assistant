# 🎙️ AI Voice Assistant for Web

A **local, web-based AI voice assistant** that performs real-time speech recognition and executes browser actions using a **trained intent recognition model**.

This project demonstrates a complete **AI pipeline**:

> **Speech → Text → Intent (trained ML model) → Action**

Built with **open-source models**, **local inference**, and a real working system suitable for academic evaluation.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Build a voice-controlled web assistant using **open-source AI**
- Train and deploy a **custom intent classification model**
- Perform **local speech-to-text inference** (no cloud APIs)
- Execute browser actions based on user voice commands
- Deliver a complete AI system for **Semester 1 practicum**

---

## 🧠 AI Models Used

### 1️⃣ Speech Recognition (Pretrained Model)

- **Model:** Whisper (via `whisper.cpp`)
- **Type:** Open-source pretrained speech-to-text model
- **Execution:** Local CPU inference
- **Supported models:** `tiny.en`, `base.en` (dynamic selection)

Whisper converts raw microphone audio into text in real time.

---

### 2️⃣ Intent Recognition (Trained Model)

- **Type:** Supervised machine learning classifier
- **Training data:** Custom dataset (`intent_dataset.csv`)
- **Technique:** TF-IDF vectorization + lightweight classifier
- **Output:** Command intent + extracted slots

This model satisfies the requirement to **train and deploy an AI model**.

## 🗂️ Supported Intent Classes

| Intent      | Description                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `open_site` | Open safe websites (YouTube, ChatGPT, Google, etc.) |
| `search`    | Search for spoken queries                           |
| `scroll`    | Scroll page up or down                              |
| `navigate`  | Go back or go home                                  |
| `get_time`  | Get current system time                             |
| `help`      | Show available commands                             |
| `unknown`   | Fallback for unrecognized input                     |
